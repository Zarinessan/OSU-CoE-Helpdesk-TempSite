# OSU-CoE-Helpdesk-TempSite
Helpdesk shift exchanging web application

This web application was used to "temp" shifts to other coworkers at the Oregon State Universit College of Engineering Helpdesk. It was developed using Google App Script which has access to Google Sheets through Google Drive. 

The documentation is written so that hopefully anyone could read it and understand what is happening in the background. We do not use a database for this web application. By building each shift directly from the scheduling spreadsheet team leads at the CoE Helpdesk will not need to have any special knowledge to have the tempsite working correctly. This also allows the schedule to be changed and for those changes to be instantly shown on the tempsite. 

I want to note that this project was made because the previous system was not capable of large scale changes. Many additional features can still be added and changes as necessary for the future. 

Some comments include the string "Might be useful later" since they were added with the future in mind.
